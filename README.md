# IEEE-course---AI-for-Power-Energy-Systems
This repository provides source code examples and Jupyter notebooks used in the online course named "*AI for Power &amp; Energy Systems: Computation Acceleration in Modeling and Control*" by [Dr. Fran Li](https://www.eecs.utk.edu/people/fangxing-fran-li/) at the University of Tennessee.  
The goal is to help participants run and explore the code during or after the course with minimal setup.  


## How to Use

We provide two options depending on your background and environment:

### 1. Easiest Option – Run on Google Colab (No Installation Required)
- Upload the `.ipynb` notebook file(s) from this repository to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Simply open the file in Colab and click **Run All**.  
- No local installation or configuration is required. This is the recommended method for first-time users.  

### 2. Advanced Option – Run Locally with Python
If you already have Python and Jupyter installed on your computer:
1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` files.  
2. Make sure your Python environment includes the required packages:  

   ```
   numpy
   pandas
   matplotlib
   tensorflow
   pandapower
   jupyterlab
   ```  
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.  
4. Open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells.  

This option is more flexible for users with prior Python experience.
